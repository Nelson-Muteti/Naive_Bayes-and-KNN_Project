* There are two datasets, one involving Titanic data and the other an Email Spam classification problem data.

* I am supposed to build a KNN ML model to train the Titanic data and classify survival  of passengers on new unseen data (Test.csv).

* On the Spam data, I am suppoosed to build a Naive_Bayes ML model to correctly classify email as Spam or not Spam given 

 frequency of some words in the emails.

## Technologies Used

* I Used Google Colab as my primary work environment.
